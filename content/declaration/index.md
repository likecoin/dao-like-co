【The Declaration of LikeCoin DAO】- 2025.02.08

To build a DAO through Likes, supported by coins.

"Like" is “讚”; Coin is “托”; "DAO" is “邦”.

LikeCoin DAO is founded on the infrastructure and practice of publishing, with the greater ambition of fostering a new, universal cultural paradigm.

The meaning of a "Like" is affection, appreciation, support, recognition, connection, sharing, and also value exchange.

We use LikeCoin as our token to transform "Likes" into a medium for value storage and exchange, realizing a cultural vision through material technology.

The value we speak of is the value of people, not the value of commodities; the exchange we speak of is reciprocal and equal between people—gifts and rewards, not speculation or consumption.

Our vision is: to use "Likes" to record history, preserve culture, encourage autonomy, protect freedom, and revolutionize publishing. We provide support and incentives, eliminate barriers and obstacles, allowing creators to be directly rewarded and readers to freely access information.

We are committed to building a user-friendly, low-barrier technical entry point and welcome all who share the same philosophy to join.

We are committed to making LikeLand transcend the limitations of time, place, and person, becoming a widespread technological application and cultural practice that is open, free, and shared.

We are not just "us," but also "you" and "they." We are a plurality of people, a community of free association and shared value. As long as you are willing to Like, you are a Liker - citizen of the LikeCoin DAO.

# LikeCoin Declaration

## Our Vision

LikeCoin represents a fundamental shift in how we think about content, creativity, and ownership in the digital age.

## Core Principles

### Decentralization
We believe in removing intermediaries between creators and their audiences, enabling direct relationships and fair compensation.

### Ownership
Creators should own their work and control how it's distributed, monetized, and preserved.

### Transparency
Blockchain technology ensures transparent, immutable records of content ownership and transactions.

### Community Governance
The LikeCoin DAO empowers the community to shape the protocol's future through democratic participation.

## Our Mission

To build a sustainable ecosystem where:
- Creators are fairly compensated for their work
- Readers have direct access to quality content
- Publishing is accessible to all
- Community governance drives innovation

## Join Us

Be part of the movement to reshape digital publishing. Participate in governance, contribute to development, or simply support creators on the platform.

Together, we're building the future of content.
